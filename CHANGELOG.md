# Changelog

All notable changes to LuxaforPresence will be documented here. This project is currently in alpha; expect rapid iteration and possible breaking changes between versions.

## [Unreleased] – Alpha Preview

- Initial menu bar app that infers “in meeting” state using mic/camera activity plus a foreground-app allowlist and updates the Luxafor flag accordingly.
- Manual overrides (Force On/Off) exposed via the status menu.
- Packaging script (`scripts/package-dmg.sh`) to build a distributable `.dmg`.
- Roadmap for additional signals, logging, and override UX tracked in `PLAN.md` and `PLAN_2.md`.
